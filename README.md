SmarterBlocker is a chrome extensions that takes mature approach to blocking adult content. 
Instead of blocking access to adult websites it simply either redirects user to some motivational posts,

for sophisticated porn blocking systems, but its just a fun project that appears suprisingly useful and efficient.
